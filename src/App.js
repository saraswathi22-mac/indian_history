      <h1>Stone Age</h1>
      <p>
        The people of this age used to fulfil all their needs only with the help
        of stone tools, hence this era is called Stone age. On the basis of all
        the evidence obtained so far, 5L BC, the period from 2500AD is
        considered to be the prehistoric age of Indian human progress. Scholars
        have divided this stone age into 3 parts a. Paleolithic/Ice age- 2
        millionBC-10000BC b. Mesolithic - 10000-8000BC c. Neolithic-8000-4000BC
      </p>
      <p>
        About 4.4 million yrs ago, fossils of the earliest human found in
        Africa. The earliest human beings were shorter in height and had a
        smaller brain. In India, the only hominid fossil found from Hathnora in
        the narmada valley.{" "}
      </p>
      <h4>Paleolithic/Ice age</h4>
      <p>
        1.Archaeologists have named the time when early humans used stone, the
        Paleolithic period. 2.The word is derived from ancient and stone. 3.
        This was the day when man used stones the most. Acc to archaelogists,
        the Palaeolithic period is from 20 million yrs ago to 12000 yrs ago. 4.
        This era is divided into 3 parts - early, middle, late palaeolithic. 5.
        It is beleived that man has lived fro the longest time in this era. 6.
        In this era, man didnt do farming but used to hunt using stones. 7. In
        this era people lived in caves. Tools of paleolithic era: Chopper,
        Handaxe, cleaver The most imp thing that humans learned in this era was
        to light fire. The fire was used for various purposes. Remnants of the
        ashes of this era have been found in the Kurnool caves in south india. -
        Archaelogists have discovered sites of thiss era from Pune-Nashik
        region, Hoosgi area of Karnataka, Kurnools region of AP. There are many
        rivers in this areas - Tapti, Godavari, Krishna Bhima, Wardha etc. Many
        paleolithic weapons made of limestone have been found in these places. -
        Due to rivers, there is moisture in the climate of these places. Many
        skelettons of rhinoceros and wild bulls have been found here. From this,
        it is estimated that these areas will receive more rainfall in this era
        than today. - It has been estimated on the basis that rhinoceros and
        wild bull prefer to live in moist places. - The Paleolithic is
        characterised by the use of knapped stone tools, although at the time
        humans also used wood and bone tools - People are learned to build fires
        - Kept records and communicated using cave paintings - belief in the
        after life so started to bury the dead.

      <p>Hunting, herders ie domestication - first animal is dog.</p>- Stone
      tools were microliths - There was a change in the temperature. The heat
      rose. Due to increasing heat, crops like barley, wheat, paddy, started
      growing. People of this time also lived in caves. - Humans domesticated
      and fed these animals with fodder. Thus in the Mesolithic period, man
      became a pastoralist. - In this era, along with farming, man used to do
      fishing, collecting honey, hunting etc. - evidence of domestication of
      animals - adamgarh, MP and bagor, Rajasthan - many sites from this era
      have been found in west, central india, mysore. People in this mesolithic
      age were maily cattle herders. - Paisra(bihar), langnaj(gujrat), baghor II
      - characteristics: 1. During this age, man had invented the samll tool
      like spearheads, arrow heads, etc 2. The main mesolithic age had started
      taming the dogs for the hunting purpose. 3. The man of this age was still
      a food collector and not a food producer

        handycrafts, loom

        knowledge of the agricultural method. This is the 3rd and final episode
        of stone age. 4000-2500bc. The brain of man had become more developed.
        Evidence found in south of Godavari river, south india. In this era,
        indian humans established settlements near granite hills or river bamks.
        In eastern india, humans lived in the delatas of the Ganges,Son, Gandak
