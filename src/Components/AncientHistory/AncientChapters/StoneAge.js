        <h1>Stone Age</h1>
        <p>
          The people of this age used to fulfil all their needs only with the help
          of stone tools, hence this era is called Stone age. On the basis of all
          the evidence obtained so far, 5L BC, the period from 2500AD is
          considered to be the prehistoric age of Indian human progress. Scholars
          have divided this stone age into 3 parts a. Paleolithic/Ice age- 2
          millionBC-10000BC b. Mesolithic - 10000-8000BC c. Neolithic-8000-4000BC

          About 4.4 million yrs ago, fossils of the earliest human found in
          Africa. The earliest human beings were shorter in height and had a
          smaller brain. In India, the only hominid fossil found from Hathnora in
          the narmada valley.{" "}

        <h4>Paleolithic/Ice age</h4>
        <p>
          1.Archaeologists have named the time when early humans used stone, the
          Paleolithic period. 2.The word is derived from ancient and stone. 3.
          This was the day when man used stones the most. Acc to archaelogists,
          the Palaeolithic period is from 20 million yrs ago to 12000 yrs ago. 4.
          This era is divided into 3 parts - early, middle, late palaeolithic. 5.
          It is beleived that man has lived fro the longest time in this era. 6.
          In this era, man didnt do farming but used to hunt using stones. 7. In
          this era people lived in caves. Tools of paleolithic era: Chopper,
          Handaxe, cleaver The most imp thing that humans learned in this era was
          to light fire. The fire was used for various purposes. Remnants of the
          ashes of this era have been found in the Kurnool caves in south india. -
          Archaelogists have discovered sites of thiss era from Pune-Nashik
          region, Hoosgi area of Karnataka, Kurnools region of AP. There are many
          rivers in this areas - Tapti, Godavari, Krishna Bhima, Wardha etc. Many
          paleolithic weapons made of limestone have been found in these places. -
          Due to rivers, there is moisture in the climate of these places. Many
          skelettons of rhinoceros and wild bulls have been found here. From this,
          it is estimated that these areas will receive more rainfall in this era
          than today. - It has been estimated on the basis that rhinoceros and
          wild bull prefer to live in moist places. - The Paleolithic is
          characterised by the use of knapped stone tools, although at the time
          humans also used wood and bone tools - People are learned to build fires
          - Kept records and communicated using cave paintings - belief in the
          after life so started to bury the dead.

        <h4>Mesolithic/Microlithic age</h4>
        <p>Hunting, herders ie domestication - first animal is dog.</p>- Stone
        tools were microliths - There was a change in the temperature. The heat
        rose. Due to increasing heat, crops like barley, wheat, paddy, started
        growing. People of this time also lived in caves. - Humans domesticated
        and fed these animals with fodder. Thus in the Mesolithic period, man
        became a pastoralist. - In this era, along with farming, man used to do
        fishing, collecting honey, hunting etc. - evidence of domestication of
        animals - adamgarh, MP and bagor, Rajasthan - many sites from this era
        have been found in west, central india, mysore. People in this mesolithic
        age were maily cattle herders. - Paisra(bihar), langnaj(gujrat), baghor II
        - characteristics: 1. During this age, man had invented the samll tool
        like spearheads, arrow heads, etc 2. The main mesolithic age had started
        taming the dogs for the hunting purpose. 3. The man of this age was still
        a food collector and not a food producer
        <h4>Neolithic/new stone age</h4>
        <p>
          Agriculture, domesticated, burials, tamed, storehouse, village, housing,
          handycrafts, loom
        </p>
        <p>
          In this era, people became producer of food, ie they had a good
          knowledge of the agricultural method. This is the 3rd and final episode
          of stone age. 4000-2500bc. The brain of man had become more developed.
          Evidence found in south of Godavari river, south india. In this era,
          indian humans established settlements near granite hills or river bamks.
          In eastern india, humans lived in the delatas of the Ganges,Son, Gandak
          and Ghagara rivers
